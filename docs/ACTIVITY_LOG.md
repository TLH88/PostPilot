## 2026-04-01: Full Product Evaluation + Phase 0 Implementation

### Evaluation Reports Completed
Four parallel agent teams conducted full product evaluation:

1. **UVP Evaluation** — Assessed unique value proposition delivery at 70%. Strongest asset: voice personalization (85%). Biggest gap: no analytics or feedback loop. Recommended repositioning to "The only LinkedIn tool that keeps YOUR voice authentically you."

2. **Product Evaluation** — Overall score 6.5/10. Strong AI quality (8.5/10) and code quality (8/10). Critical gaps: no direct LinkedIn posting, no analytics, no team collaboration. Recommended 4-phase roadmap over 12-18 months.

3. **Pricing Strategy** — Designed 3-tier pricing model (Free/$19/$49) with BYOK as default across all tiers. Break-even at ~8 paying users ($150/mo covers $130.42/mo costs + 15% profit). Year 1 projections: $25K-$150K ARR.

4. **QA & Code Audit** — Grade B+. No critical security issues. Found unused deps (verified actually used), missing Zod validation, console.error in production routes. All fixable items addressed.

### QA Fixes Implemented (commit `0944439`)
- Added Zod input validation schemas to all 5 AI API routes
- Added Zod response validation for brainstorm and hashtag AI outputs
- Created shared `src/lib/api-utils.ts` with `logApiError()` (API key redaction)
- Replaced bare `console.error` with structured JSON logging in 9 API routes
- Extracted hardcoded timeouts and file size limits to named constants in `src/lib/constants.ts`

### Phase 0 Features Implemented
1. **Hook Analysis Feature** (new)
   - Created `/api/ai/analyze-hook` endpoint with Zod validation
   - Added `HOOK_ANALYSIS_INSTRUCTIONS` prompt to `src/lib/ai/prompts.ts`
   - Added "Analyze Hook" button to post editor formatting toolbar
   - Displays color-coded card (green/yellow/red) with strength rating, technique, feedback, and suggested improvement
   - Uses user's own AI key (BYOK, zero cost to us)

2. **History-Enhanced Brainstorming**
   - Modified `/api/ai/brainstorm` to query user's recent posts (15) and ideas (10)
   - Injects post titles, content pillars, and statuses into AI context
   - Calculates content pillar distribution and flags underserved pillars
   - AI now avoids repeating topics and prioritizes content gaps

3. **Content Pillar Distribution** (dashboard)
   - Added "Content Pillar Balance" card to dashboard
   - Shows bar chart of posts per pillar with percentage breakdown
   - Highlights underserved pillars with yellow "needs content" indicator
   - Queries from posts table, cross-references with creator profile pillars

4. **Export to LinkedIn** (clipboard copy)
   - Added "Copy Post" button to post editor formatting toolbar
   - Copies post content + hashtags with proper formatting to clipboard
   - Shows success toast confirming ready to paste into LinkedIn

### Documentation
- Created `docs/GTM-STRATEGY.md` with pricing targets, launch plan, marketing channels, revenue projections
- Created `docs/ACTIVITY_LOG.md` (this file)

### Infrastructure
- Added dev-only auto-login via Supabase service role key (bypasses LinkedIn OAuth on localhost)
- Created `/api/dev/auto-login` endpoint (returns 404 in production)
- Updated callback route to handle magic link tokens
- Set `autoPort: false` in `.claude/launch.json` for OAuth callback compatibility
